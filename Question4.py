# Q4. Explain the concept of gradient descent. How is it used in machine learning?

# Answer - Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning to minimize a cost or loss function and find the optimal values for model parameters. It's a key component of training various machine learning models, 
# including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more.

# its also enabling the training of accurate and effective machine learning models.

# The process continues until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion can be a fixed number of iterations, reaching a predefined level of cost function improvement, or other conditions.
