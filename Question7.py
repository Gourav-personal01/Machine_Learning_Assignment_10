# # Q7. Describe the polynomial regression model. How is it different from linear regression?

# Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis that extends the concept of linear regression to model relationships between the dependent variable (target) and independent variables (predictors) using polynomial functions. While linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the target, polynomial regression allows for more complex and nonlinear relationships to be captured.

# In polynomial regression, the predictors are transformed by raising them to positive integer powers, known as polynomial degrees. The most common polynomial degrees are 2 (quadratic), 3 (cubic), and so on.

# Differences Between Linear and Polynomial Regression:

# Linearity vs. Nonlinearity: The primary difference is the assumption about the relationship between predictors and the target. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship, while polynomial regression allows for nonlinear relationships.

# Model Complexity: Linear regression is a simpler model that fits a straight line to the data. Polynomial regression is more flexible and can fit curves of varying complexity, depending on the polynomial degree.

# Underfitting and Overfitting: In linear regression, underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns, while overfitting occurs when it is too complex. In polynomial regression, higher polynomial degrees can lead to overfitting if not carefully controlled.

# Predictor Transformation: In linear regression, predictors are used as-is, without transformation. In polynomial regression, predictors are transformed by raising them to higher powers.
